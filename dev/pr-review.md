# Review everything (adaptive multi-lens orchestrator)

<task>Review Everything: Adversarial multi-lens review of a PR diff. Classifies the diff, applies the relevant adversarial lenses (pr-review + up to 5 specialized lenses), dedupes findings across lenses, and produces one unified P0/P1/P2 list. For trivial diffs, classification skips most lenses and the output is essentially a focused pr-review; for substantial diffs, you get the full battery.</task>

<analysis>
STAGE 1 — CLASSIFY THE DIFF (always)
Run `git diff main...HEAD` (or master—check which base). For each lens, decide APPLY or SKIP based on what's in the diff. Output a classification table.

Lens preconditions:
- pr-review: ALWAYS (every diff gets a structured pass against project patterns)
- security-gate: APPLY if diff touches inputs/outputs, auth, network, secrets, dependencies, or any user-controllable surface. SKIP if purely formatting/comments/internal-types/test-fixtures.
- performance-profiler: APPLY if diff touches per-request paths, per-user-action paths, DB queries, network calls, or hot loops. SKIP if build-config/docs/non-runtime.
- ux-critique: APPLY if any change is user-facing—UI, copy, navigation, error states. SKIP if backend-only or developer-tool-only.
- migration-safety: APPLY if any change touches DB schema, API contracts, config formats, or wire protocols. SKIP if no contracts change.
- quality-hunt: APPLY if the diff contains a bug fix. SKIP if purely additive feature work or mechanical refactor.

Output:
| Lens | APPLY/SKIP | Reason |
| pr-review | APPLY | always |
| security-gate | … | … |
| performance-profiler | … | … |
| ux-critique | … | … |
| migration-safety | … | … |
| quality-hunt | … | … |

STAGE 2 — APPLY LENSES (parallel if you have Task() in Claude Code; else sequential)
For each APPLY lens, run its standard analysis on the diff. Required output per lens: P0/P1/P2 findings with confidence (1-10) and specific fixes. Standalone triggers ::QS / ::QP / ::UX / ::QM / ::QH have the full lens spec — fall back to those for max rigor. The pr-review lens (project-pattern pass: lessons-learned, file categories, coverage gaps) lives only here; no standalone.

Distinguishing rules the standalones may not emphasize:
- Security: try concrete payloads, not abstract category checklists
- Performance: triage dimensions that matter for THESE changes; don't list-check
- Migration: surface the point-of-no-return in the rollback path
- Quality hunt: only fires on bug fixes; goal is finding the same root pattern elsewhere

STAGE 3 — DEDUPE FINDINGS (mandatory)
Key by (file, line, semantic-fingerprint). Merge: provenance tag (e.g. "security + performance"), highest severity wins. Conflicting fixes → surface BOTH; don't silently pick.

STAGE 4 — CROSS-LENS PATTERNS (0-3; skip with reason if none)
Patterns visible only across lenses: clustering in one file (high-risk area), same root cause as multiple symptoms (fix cause, not instances), lenses disagreeing on severity (surface, don't pick), shared data-flow concerns (riskiest part of diff).

STAGE 5 — VERIFIER LOOP (max 3, confidence-gated)
"What did the lenses miss given this consolidated view?" Output: (a) new findings, (b) confidence 1-10 that the review is now exhaustive.
Stop when: confidence ≥ 8, OR confidence < 8 but no new findings (diminishing returns), OR 3 iterations reached.
Confidence is honest judgment, not a cargo-cult 9.

STAGE 6 — PROOF-OF-UNDERSTANDING FOR EVERY P0
In your own words (not copy-pasted): (1) what the issue is, (2) how it manifests as a concrete failure scenario, (3) what the structural fix is. If you can't produce all three coherently, downgrade to P1 with note "needs human review."
</analysis>

<report>
Output in order:
1. Classification table
2. Verifier loop trace (iterations, confidence per pass, reason for stopping)
3. Findings P0/P1/P2 — each: file:line, issue, lens provenance, proof (what/manifests/fix), confidence
4. Cross-lens patterns (or "none")
5. Overall PR readiness 1-10 with confidence anchor; specific blockers if <8
6. What was skipped (each lens + reason — so misclassification can be spotted)
</report>

<rules>
- Confidence anchors: 1-3=guessing, 4-6=informed but unverified, 7-8=verified by reading code, 9-10=verified with test run or external source
- Skip with one-line reason — never fabricate findings to fill a section
- Run lenses fresh — don't let one lens's findings prejudice the next
- DEDUPE is mandatory; concatenating per-lens output without dedup is a failure of this prompt
- Conflicting fixes → surface explicitly; don't silently pick
- Top 10-15 deduped findings max
- If context missing (no diff, unclear scope, mid-refactor), STOP and ask one clarifying question
- For deeper single-lens passes: ::QS / ::QP / ::UX / ::QM / ::QH
</rules>
